# Layer2Rand
A layer2 randomness generator for blockchain with high efficiency and security

The purpose of this respository is to
- show how layer2 randomness can be achieved with light computation and communication overhead, without involving third-party
- high security with misbehavior being punished with blockchain smart contracts
- high randmoness proven with NIST random test suite
- completely no degraded user experience
- better with p2p channels such as lighting network 

What it can be used for?
- fair games with verifiable randomness
- any game involving dices such as backgammon
- any game with p2p or multiplayer fighting such as League of Legends
- not suitable for games with contrainted rules such as Texas Hold'em, for such scenarios, see my another project

What's not included
- the game logic, which can be various and indpendent of this layer
- the blockchain smart contract, which is related to the game logic
